    <h3> <em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>Paneer butter masala is a delicious rich and creamy vegetarian Indian curry. This recipe is easy to make at home in just 30 minutes with cubes of paneer, onions, cashews, and Indian spices in a buttery tomato sauce.</p>
    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>

        <li>½ pound paneer, cut into ½-inch cubes</li>
            
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            
        <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
            
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
            
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
            
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cashews</li>
            
        <li>1 teaspoon ground red chiles</li>
            
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry paneer in batches until golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer fried paneer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, retaining vegetable oil in skillet.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add ginger paste and garlic paste. Continue to cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Stir cashews, ground red chiles, cumin, coriander, and garam masala into the onion mixture. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir tomato sauce, half-and-half, milk, sugar, and salt into spice mixture; simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add fried paneer and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
