This is basic HTML project provided to me by the Odin-foundatiob Course
# Project: Recipes
## Description
This project is a simple recipe website that allows users to view and add recipes. The website will have links to different recipes which the user will be able to access

Further in the course, I will style this website with CSS and add functionality with JavaScript
